## How To Build / Compile
This is a Godot project. If you're familiar with source control, then "clone this repo". Otherwise download the contents and place them in an empty folder that's in a convenient place.  Open Godot, ``Import Project`` and navigate to the folder you just made.  select ``project.godot`` and you're good to go.

No compiling necessary!  This is Godot, after all.
